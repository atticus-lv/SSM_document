A variety of ways to align the ground (or active item), with the position **TransPSR** can have a greater role

### Alignment principle

> non mesh object alignment: its origin
>
> mesh object alignment: the highest or lowest point in the world Z axis

#### Alignment 1: all (lowest) > World floor

Most of the time, the method will be used to maintain the integrity of the selected objects' **structure**

> When selecting a single object, the alignment point of the single object is taken as the lowest point
>
> When selecting multiple objects, the lowest alignment point of multiple objects will be taken as the lowest point (**mesh object first**)

#### Alignment 2: all > World floor

> Hold down **Ctrl** and click the D2F button

#### Alignment 3: all > active

> Hold down shift and click the D2f button

#### Alignment settings: all (excluding non MESH)

If checked, it has no effect on the movement of non-mesh objects, but it can still be used as the alignment target
